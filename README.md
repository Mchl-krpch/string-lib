# string-lib  second project on asm

ðŸ’» Implementation of well-known functions but in a different language. Functions have already been written here that use registers and change their values, that is, the use of such functions may affect the operation of other elements of the project, so you need to use them carefully

## Essence of the project

My second assembly language project, implemented standard string functions from C, such as
* strlen - essence of the project
* strcmp - compare strings lexicographically
* strchr - find a character in a string
* strcpy - copy a string to another string

## Process

Commands like [scasb](http://www.club155.ru/x86cmd/SCASB) helped me a lot, this makes the functions look extremely short, this project, unlike the first one, was written extremely quickly

## New info
* scasb - compares value es:[di] with al
* loop  - repeats some action until cx is reset to zero
* stosw - copys    value ax to es:[di]
* smpsb - compares value ds:[si] with es:[di]
* movsb - writes   ds:[si] to es:[di]

## Thanks!
I will be glad to your issue
